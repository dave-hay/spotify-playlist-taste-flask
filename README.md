This project consists of leveraging the Spotify's API to analyze a users playlist on the below variables:

-   Danceability = Can you put this song on at a party?
    -   based on tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.
-   Valence = Are you happy or emo?
    -   High valence songs are positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric)
    -   Low valence songs are negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)
-   Energy = For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.
    -   Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.
-   Temp = BPM
-   Loudness = overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB).
-   Acousticness = A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.
