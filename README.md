# Spotify Playlist Taste Visualized
<hr>
Recently I created my very first web app and only a mere month and a half ago I was just learning how to print 'Hello, world!'. I was drawn to programming because I started to see that every platform I used had an API (Application Programming Interface) and I just knew that something what behind that and curiosity got the best of me. I checked out Spotify's API and 

While still a newbie in the world of programming every day I see more and more possibilities and continually get less frustrated (that might be a lie). But, I'm proud of my project and wanted to share it with others who are interested in doing something similar.

### Overview

This project consists of leveraging the Spotify's API to analyze a users playlist on the below variables:

-   Danceability = Can you put this song on at a party?
    -   based on tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.
-   Valence = Are you happy or emo?
    -   High valence songs are positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric)
    -   Low valence songs are negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)
-   Energy = For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.
    -   Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.
-   Temp = BPM
-   Loudness = overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB).
-   Acousticness = A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.
  
### How to use

Just copy the think and paste in the app!
